# anime-seiyuu-searcher
A small app to search for info about anime series and voice actors using [Jikan API](https://jikan.moe/).
The objective was to simplify the navigation I usually go through on [MyAnimeList](https://myanimelist.net/) whenever I check which voice actor voiced a certain character. This ended up being a nice proyect to start learning about React.js
